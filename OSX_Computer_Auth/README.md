Purpose

Unlike Windows computers, Macs don't have any built-in computer authentication to allow them to connect to Wifi networks without requiring a user to login.

This script is to be used with a locally-installed mobile configuration profile in environments with Active Directory.  The config profile must have TESTUSER & TESTPASS for the Wifi profile username & pass in order to substitute the generated AD info.  

Support

I am not the original author of this script, but it was developed at my institution.  I can provide what help I can provide if you have issues.

Script Failures

Every once in a while the config profile and script will fail to get a computer online.  In these rare events, see the other script in the repo for removing to try again.
